## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
I utilized the HTML elements reference guide on developer.mozilla.org and couldn't see where I ought to replace any of the HTLM tags/elements or ancors.
I did however organize things in a way that made more sense to me when reading down as there appeared to be extra spacing after an img source and the closing tag with those sources.
I also modified the header to include a title page that summed up what the client was requesting.
I did not modify the CSS as when I attempted to do that I broke the page.
Please advise if I have totally missed something obvious as I've spent days reading over and comparing the code and the HTML elements used in the MDN reference guides and other sources.
